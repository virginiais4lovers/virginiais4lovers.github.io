      What Virginia has brought to our team as an advisor is difficult to quantify. It is not simply that she is an expert in online retail, but that she has a way of clarifying muddy waters and cutting through nonsense incredibly quickly.
  - name: "Ryan Brown"
    reference: >
      With all of her experience, it would be easy for Virginia to give strict recommendations and advice, but the world is nuanced, and Virginia knows that everyone has to find their own way. I go back to Virginia again and again not because she tells me what to do, but because she asks me what I need to answer. She helps me understand the implicit tradeoffs and opportunity costs, and puts the ball back into my court with a defining question that only I can answer. This has an empowering effect where I come to trust myself for the decisions I've made.

      Very rarely do you encounter leaders like Virginia—she leads by letting you choose your own direction, while encouraging, teaching, and inspiring you along the way. Because of this leadership quality, it's impossible not to want to create the best work possible and take on more challenges when she's at the helm of a project.
