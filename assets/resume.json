I go back to Virginia again and again not because she tells me what to do, but because she asks me what I need to answer. She helps me understand the implicit tradeoffs and opportunity costs, and puts the ball back into my court with a defining question that only I can answer. This has an empowering effect where I come to trust myself for the decisions I've made.\n"},{"name":"Sarah Doll","reference":"I learned things that year both fundamental and professional that I will carry with me forever.\n"},{"name":"Scott Rocher","reference":"It takes a leader with business skills, unwavering passion, and focus to build a company from concept to acquisition.\n"},{"name":"Danielle Harris","reference":"Virginia is the most efficient, effectively compassionate, and hard working leader I've come across.
